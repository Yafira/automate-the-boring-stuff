#@Logging Levels

#DEBUG: logging.debug() >> The lowest level. Used for small details. Usually you care about these messages only when diagnosing problems.

#INFO: logging.info() >> Used to record information on general events in your program or confirm that things are working at their point in the program.

#WARNING: logging.warning() >> Used to indicate a potential problem that doesnâ€™t prevent the program from working but might do so in the future.

#ERROR: logging.error() >> Used to record an error that caused the program to fail to do something.

#CRITICAL: logging.critical() >> The highest level. Used to indicate a fatal error that has caused or is about to cause the program to stop running entirely.
